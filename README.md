My Movie Critic
Author: Alex Baransky

This application is designed to compare ratings you assign to five different movies to the ratings of professional movies critics. This method finds the movie critics whose taste in movies are most aligned with your own!

Unlike other algorithms that simply suggest movies you might enjoy, this application directly suggests real critics who you can follow. This technique adds the advantage of seeing a critic's detailed review of a movie and what they liked or disliked about it. Now you can know why you might like a movie, not just whether or not (for some unknown reason) it might interest you!

I created this application as a project for the NYC Data Science Academy Immersive Data Science Bootcamp. Using the scrapy python package, I extracted the data that the app uses behind the scenes to perform the critic match. This application uses movie review data from RottenTomatoes.com to calculate the matches. The data consists of over 1,000 movies and ratings for each movie from almost 3,500 certified movie critics. The movies include top rated films between the years 2000 and 2018 and only those films that were reviewed by 100 or more critics.
